# 123-Movies-Clone
A 123 movies clone for personal practice.
The thing is, I made this a while back ago when I didn't know how to really use Github. It took me about 11 days of passive coding to get it in this form. Currently I've postponed it until I've got a solid understanding on MongoDB, because scalability with just HTML, CSS and JS whilst possible, would be really unefficient. So until then its purely a frontend project for the most part.

It has a functional search bar, nice visual design, a good sleek slider with infotabs that appear on hover, and is good from a frontend perspective.
